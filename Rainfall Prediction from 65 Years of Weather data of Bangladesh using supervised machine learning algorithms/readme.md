## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preprocessing
<p align="justify">
Collected 65 years of weather data (1948â€“2013) from Kaggle. Data was preprocessed by removing outliers and normalizing features.
</p>

### Model Development
<p align="justify">
Implemented multiple machine learning models and tuned hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
</p>

### Evaluation
<p align="justify">
Data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Models were evaluated using R-squared and RMSE metrics.
