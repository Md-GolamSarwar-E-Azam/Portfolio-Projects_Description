# Factory â€“ Manufacturing Efficiency Analysis (Power BI)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary
In this project I have analyzed **manufacturing efficiency data** for an **RMG (Ready-Made Garments) factory** to gain insights into production performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize operational efficiency.  
Key metrics such as **planned hours, actual produced hours, efficiency, and Non-Productive Time (NPT)** were examined to highlight opportunities for improvement.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Findings

### 1. Daily Performance
- Compared **planned hours vs. actual produced hours** to track daily performance.  
- Identified **bottlenecks** and areas with **low efficiency**.  
- Measured the **impact of NPT** on daily productivity.  

### 2. Monthly Performance
- Assessed **monthly production performance**, identifying key trends and variations.  
- Evaluated the **effect of NPT** on monthly efficiency.  

### 3. Departmental Performance
- Compared performance across **departments** to identify strengths and weaknesses.  
- Highlighted opportunities for **cross-functional collaboration** and process improvement.
